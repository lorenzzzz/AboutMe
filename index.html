                <h4>Bee Movie Script</h4>
                <div class="markdown-container left-text">
                    According to all known laws
                    of aviation,
                    there is no way a bee
                    should be able to fly.
                    Its wings are too small to get
                    its fat little body off the ground.
                    The bee, of course, flies anyway
                    because bees don't care
                    what humans think is impossible.
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    , black and yellow!
                    Let's shake it up a little.
                    Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                    Ooming!
                    Hang on a second.

                    Looking sharp.
                    Use the stairs. Your father
                    paid good money for those.
                    Sorry. I'm excited.
                    Here's the graduate.

                    A perfect report card, all B's.
                    Very proud.
                    Ma! I got a thing going here.
                    - You got lint on your fuzz.
                    - Ow! That's me!
                    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                    - Bye!
                    Barry, I told you,
                    stop flying in the house!
                    - Hey, Adam.
                    - Hey, Barry.
                    - Is that fuzz gel?
                    - A little. Special day, graduation.
                    Never thought I'd make it.
